If you decide to not finish the experiment you have the option to request your data to be deleted.  
                  We will collect data from you through a daily in-app questionnaire, and two separate in-app monthly questionnaires. The data will be stored remotely and securely using cloud services. If you use an Oura ring, you can grant us access to your sleep data by providing by following instructions within the app. The Oura application synchronises the sensor data from your Oura ring and stores the information in a secure remote server. 
                  You can access your own data through the Oura smartphone application or through the API provided by Oura. The data is stored anonymously.'''),
